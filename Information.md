#Snowballs distract zombie whereever they hit, the zombie go. if you hit a player, zombie will target that player. 

#Headshots with bows'n'arrow do more 100% more damage then normal shots. 

#Nothing stacks with an exception of: arrows, food

#Health potions are a very effective way of healting! Splash hp pots heal u and all players around you plus they kill all zombies in radius.

#Zombies can poison you! Antidote is milk or someone can heal u using shears + milk.

#Graves can be dug up with a diamond gold shovel. Graves have very good equipment in them.

#Sugar = drugs. It makes u have speed 3. After the speed wares off neasua 2 blindness 1 activates. 

#Zombies can make you bleed at a change of 10% on hit. Banadages stop bleeding and heal you one heart.

#Zombies; zombies run faster than you, are smarter than usual, horde, hit harder, infect you, and make you bleed.

#Your expirence level is your water level. max = 20. When you have 0 levels you start losing 1hp/second

#If you get 8kills in your single life you get the [Bandit] rank which gives you the bandit kit which constists of iron sword and chestplate.

#If you heal 80people in your lifetime you get the [Healer] rank forever.
